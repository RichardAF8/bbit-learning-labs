# BLIT Tech Lab Hackathon Repository

This repository contains a barebones fullstack project, meant to be enhanced by participants in order to turn it into a fullstack, data-caching tech lab for students to work on.

## Background
The idea of this lab is to offer exposure to building a web application. Students will get a basic understanding how a web application is created
